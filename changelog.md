I added the new pages (simple dialog, custom dialog, crud, and styled crud) to the navigation bar.
I added image links to my github and linkedin on my projects page. I also added style to the images.
I added project descriptions to each of my projects.

I added google analytics to each html page of my website. I decided to use it to tell me information about the users of my site so I can see how people would interact with it.
I added the script for each of the analytics just below the head tag.
